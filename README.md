- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maniakuso
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in hybrid text experiments, audio synthesis, emacs, technical communication, UX writing, and screenwriting. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the art of computer programming. 
- ðŸŒ± My purpose is to present my creative work, tinker and learn a coding language, build audio pieces, and, in general, use this as a space of improvisation and technical growth. May it be so.
